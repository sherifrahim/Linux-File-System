## **Module 1: Introduction to Linux**

Linux is a free and open-source OS first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. It's widely used across servers, mobile systems, cybersecurity, and even supercomputers.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Open Source**: Freely available and modifiable.
- **Security**: Resilient against malware.
- **Stability**: Favored for high-uptime systems.
- **Flexibility**: Highly customizable.
- **Performance**: Optimized for multitasking.

### **Popular Use Cases**
- Web servers and enterprise systems
- Embedded devices and IoT
- Mobile systems (Android)
- Cybersecurity and DevOps

### **Popular Linux Distributions**
- Ubuntu
- Fedora
- Arch Linux

## **Understanding Linux File Systems**

Linux uses file systems to manage and store data hierarchically.

### **File System Basics**
- Root directory: `/`
- Files & Directories: Organized in trees
- Mount Points: Devices mounted to directories
- Metadata: Info like permissions, timestamps

### **Common File Systems**
- **ext4**: Stable and widely used
- **XFS**: High-performance, scalable
- **Btrfs**: Snapshotting, checksums
- **ZFS**: Data integrity, RAID-like features
- **F2FS**: Designed for flash storage

## **Module 2: File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**

The FHS standardizes Linux directory structures:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/root`   | Superuser home |
| `/bin`    | System binaries |
| `/boot`   | Bootloader and kernel |
| `/dev`    | Device files |
| `/etc`    | Configuration files |
| `/home`   | User directories |
| `/lib`    | Shared libraries |
| `/var`    | Variable data (logs, etc) |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files |

---

## **Essential Linux File Commands**

```bash
cd /home/user     # Change directory
ls -la            # List files with details
pwd               # Show current path
mkdir mydir       # Create directory
rmdir mydir       # Delete empty directory
touch file.txt    # Create file
cp file1 file2    # Copy file
mv file1 dir/     # Move or rename file
rm file.txt       # Remove file
find / -name '*.txt'  # Find files
```

---

## **Module 3: File Operations**

### **Creating & Deleting Files**
- `touch`: create file
- `rm`: delete file (`-r`, `-f` options)

### **Copying & Moving**
- `cp`: copy files (`-r` for recursive)
- `mv`: move/rename files

### **Permissions & Ownership**
```bash
chmod 755 file.txt    # Set permissions
chown user:group file # Change owner
chgrp group file      # Change group
```

---

## **Module 4: Advanced Command Usage**

### **Command Reference**
```bash
cd ~               # Go to home
ls -l              # Detailed listing
pwd                # Show current path
mkdir -p dir/sub   # Create with parents
rmdir dir          # Remove empty dir
cp -r src/ dest/   # Copy folder
mv old new         # Rename
rm -rf dir         # Delete everything
```

### **Searching Tools**
```bash
find /home -name file.txt
locate file.txt
which ls
whereis python
sudo updatedb
grep -r "term" /path
```

---

## **Compression & Archiving**

```bash
# tar
tar -cvf archive.tar folder/
tar -xvf archive.tar

# gzip
gzip file.txt
gzip -d file.txt.gz

# zip
zip archive.zip files/
unzip archive.zip

# bzip2
bzip2 file.txt
bzip2 -d file.txt.bz2
```

---

## **Module 5: File System Management**

### **Disk Usage Analysis**
```bash
df -hT     # Disk space with FS type
du -sh *   # Folder sizes
```

### **Mounting & Unmounting**
```bash
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
umount /mnt
```

Use `/etc/fstab` for persistent mounts.

### **Checking File System**
```bash
fsck /dev/sda1         # File system check
fsck -r /dev/sda1      # Interactive repair
```

*Always back up before using `fsck`.*

## **Module 6: Advanced Topics**

### **LVM (Logical Volume Manager)**
- **PVs**: Physical volumes
- **VGs**: Volume groups
- **LVs**: Logical volumes

#### **Benefits**
- Resize volumes live
- Snapshots for backup
- Striping & mirroring
- Hardware migration

### **NFS vs Samba**

| Feature | NFS | Samba |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Use | Unix/Linux sharing | Windows integration |
| Auth | Host-based | User/AD based |
| Protocol | NFS | SMB/CIFS |

---

## **RAID & File Systems**

### **RAID Levels**
- **RAID 0**: Striping – fast, no redundancy
- **RAID 1**: Mirroring – redundancy
- **RAID 5**: Striping + parity – balance
- **RAID 6**: Dual parity – more fault tolerance
- **RAID 10**: Striping + mirroring

### **RAID Implementation**
- **Hardware RAID**: Better performance, costly
- **Software RAID**: Flexible, CPU-intensive

---

## **Conclusion**

This guide covers Linux from foundational principles to advanced storage systems. Mastering file systems, tools like `fsck`, and concepts like LVM/RAID empowers system admins and power users alike to build efficient, secure, and reliable environments.
